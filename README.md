Total Effort: 22hrs from concept to submission.

## Gameplay
Left click and hold on the pump to create water bubbles. Click on a bubble to pop it. Try to extinguish all the fires, or try to control it for as long as possible to achieve a high score.

## Challenges
1. There's a physics checkbox on the room properties which disable collision. Apparently more snazzy programming is required to use physics.

2. Deploy to HTML causes an error on loading the game in the browser. Workaround is to export it using the gx.games experter instead.

3. There are bugs, but I'll keep it secret for now as this game is great fro tester training.

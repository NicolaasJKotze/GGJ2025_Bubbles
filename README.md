Freeplane was used to create a mindmap to aid in brainstorming ideas.

## How it started
![concept art of idea.](docs/Concept_FFBP.jpeg?raw=true)

The idea. As you can see, a lot of features, and so little time.


Shoot down bubbles over a fire strategically to put out the fires. Since the recent fires on Paarl mountain and in California, I think this idea can fall into a Games 4 Change category later as well with story and intro etc. 


**Goal**: Hold the fire back until it is put out.

**Game Over**: Everything is burning and the fire is out of control.

**Genre**: Fixed Shooter

**Rewards**: 
1. End game - fire is out.

2. Animals escaped.

3. Amount of properties saved.

4. Shortest time to put out a fire.

5. Biggest fire put out.

**Challenges**:
1. Pumping bubbles to save water. The water tanks takes time to refuel.

2. Running between pumping bubbles and shooting bubbles.

3. Timing to wait for bubble to be above the best location/fire.

4. Save animals trapped by the fire.

5. Saving the buildings that's on fire.

6. Small bubbles is faster to pump but slower to fly. But can be great to control breakouts and small fires.

7. Bigger bubbles is slower to pump but faster and more effective at flight and fire fighting.

8. Flareups.

9. Some animals are faster to escape, and some are slow. And many wont make it.

10. Holding out for the water drop from the air.

## Work Breakdown
![team banner image.](docs/GGJ2025_TaskBoard.jpeg?raw=true)

## 1st Layout Draft of Assets
Did this to feel the flow of moving the mouse and clicking. Trying to determine some basic useful UX that also provide some challenge.
Yes the golden rule in games is player should not battle the controls.

## 1st basic logic
Click the white button to create a bubble and click on the bubble to pop.
No random wind or size logic exist yet and only one balloon can be created per click.

## Credits
**Music and SFX** - Shawn van Staden (https://linktr.ee/shawnvanstaden)

**Everything else** - Nicolaas J. Kotze

**Total Effort**: 22hrs from concept to submission.

## Gameplay
Left click and hold on the pump to create water bubbles. Click on a bubble to pop it. Try to extinguish all the fires, or try to control it for as long as possible to achieve a high score.

## Jam Challenges
1. There's a physics checkbox on the room properties which disable collision. Apparently more snazzy programming is required to use physics.

2. Deploy to HTML causes an error on loading the game in the browser. Workaround is to export it using the gx.games experter instead.

3. Since rough placeholder art has been used, it made it difficult to determine the style of music so that the composer could start early. Luckily, we kept it simple and it worked well enough in the end with only 2 SFX and 1 song. 

4. There are bugs and missing features, but I'll keep it secret for now as this game is great fro tester training.

## Overall Experience
The direction went well. Will be nice to add the extra features. Proud that at the moment the game only uses 1 button, left-click, to do everything. Also, everything asset was self made, no 3rd party assets and no AI. 
Some research into designing art from the music or the music from the art. I think it depends on who is available and their skills and contribusion level. 
The fun part was also re-learning GameMaker Studio after 4 years not touching it. Maybe more jams are required and experiment with other tools as well.
Also, during design, it will be wise to have a diagram of the room resolusion and then mark how big 64x64, 128x128, 256x256 will be to reduce resource utilisation and faster decision making.

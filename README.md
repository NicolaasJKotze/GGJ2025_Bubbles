Freeplane was used to create a mindmap to aid in brainstorming ideas.

## How it started
![concept art of idea.](docs/Concept_FFBP.jpeg?raw=true)

Shoot down bubbles over a fire strategically to put out the fires. Since the recent fires on Paarl mountain and in California, I think this idea can fall into a Games 4 Change category later as well with story and intro etc. 


**Goal**: Hold the fire back until it is put out.

**Game Over**: Everything is burning and the fire is out of control.

**Genre**: Fixed Shooter

**Rewards**: 
1. End game - fire is out.

2. Animals escaped.

3. Amount of properties saved.

4. Shortest time to put out a fire.

5. Biggest fire put out.

**Challenges**:
1. Pumping bubbles to life water.

2. Running between pumping bubbles and shooting bubbles.

3. Timing to wait for bubble to be above the best location/fire.

4. Save animals trapped by the fire.

5. Saving the buildings that's on fire.

6. Small bubbles is faster to pump but slower to fly. But can be great to control breakouts and small fires.

7. Bigger bubbles is slower to pump but faster and more effective at flight and fire fighting.

8. Flareups.

9. Some animals are faster to escape, and some are slow. And many wont make it.

10. Holding out for the water drop from the air.

Total Effort: 22hrs from concept to submission.

## Gameplay
Left click and hold on the pump to create water bubbles. Click on a bubble to pop it. Try to extinguish all the fires, or try to control it for as long as possible to achieve a high score.

## Jam Challenges
1. There's a physics checkbox on the room properties which disable collision. Apparently more snazzy programming is required to use physics.

2. Deploy to HTML causes an error on loading the game in the browser. Workaround is to export it using the gx.games experter instead.

3. There are bugs, but I'll keep it secret for now as this game is great fro tester training.
